# Closets The Dots
This is a solution for the project of founding the closest pair of dots in a 2D page in O(nlogn) (the common solution runs in O(nlogn^2)).
## Main Trick 
The reason that this algorithm takes O(nlogn) time is that it sorts dots on their y coordinates at the beginning of the problem not after boxing dots.
