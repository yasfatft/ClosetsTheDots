# Closets The Dots
This is a solution for the project of founding the closets pair of dots in a 2D page in nlogn(the common solution run in nlogn^2 ). 
## Programming language
Python 3
#### Main Trick 
The reason that this algorithm take nlogn time is that it sort the dots base on their y coordinates in the begining of the problem not after boxing the dots
